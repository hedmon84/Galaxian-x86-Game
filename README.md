# Galaxian-x86-Game
Galaxian Game classic in x86 

Galaxian expanded the formula created by Space Invaders. Like that game, Galaxian featured a horde of attacking aliens exchanging fire with the player, but unlike Space Invaders, Galaxian added a dramatic element by having Martians attack kamikaze-style on the player-controlled ship.

The game is quite simple. Swarm after swarm of aliens attacks the player-controlled ship (called Galaxip), which can only move from left to right at the bottom of the screen. The ship can only fire one shot at a time (just like in Space Invaders), reloading when an alien is destroyed or when the shot disappears from the screen, but the shots are often quick and the ship reloads quickly. The player destroys a swarm, only to encounter another more aggressive than the previous one. A flat, repeating background with stars moves behind the action, presenting a colorful effect.
